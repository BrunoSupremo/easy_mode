## Easy Mode

This mod (for the game Stonehearth) adds a new difficult mode, "easy". The default game has peaceful, normal and hard.
For some players, normal is already too hard.
For others, it is ok, but disturbes their workflow (e.g. building).

With this mod and its new difficult, playes can focus more on all other aspects of the game. Like in peaceful, but withou losing the military content and usefulness of defenses.

### Features

In easy mode, monsters have less health, deal less damage, and takes more time to spawn.
